# Priority-Based Flight Route Optimizer: Comprehensive Q&A

## Project Overview Questions

### Q1: What is this project?
This project is a Priority-Based Flight Route Optimizer that solves a modified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with priority constraints. It's a web-based application that combines:

## Potential Examiner Questions

### Technical Questions

1. **Q: How does the priority penalty system work in the algorithms?**
   A: The priority penalty system uses a multiplication factor (1000) for priority violations. When moving from a higher priority city (lower number) to a lower priority city (higher number), a penalty is added to the route cost:
   ```python
   penalty = (from_priority - to_priority) * 1000
   ```
   This ensures that priority violations are heavily penalized while still allowing them if no better alternative exists.

2. **Q: Why use the Haversine formula for distance calculations?**
   A: The Haversine formula calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, making it ideal for accurate Earth surface distances. It accounts for the Earth's curvature, providing more accurate results than simpler Euclidean distance calculations.

3. **Q: How does the Dynamic Programming solution achieve better performance than Brute Force?**
   A: The Dynamic Programming solution uses memoization with a bitmask to store previously calculated subproblems, reducing redundant calculations. While still exponential, it's significantly faster than brute force for medium-sized inputs.

### Algorithm Questions

1. **Q: Why implement three different algorithms instead of just the most efficient one?**
   A: Multiple algorithms serve different purposes:
   - Brute Force: Guarantees optimal solution for small inputs
   - Dynamic Programming: Balances accuracy and performance
   - Greedy: Provides quick solutions for large inputs
   This allows users to choose based on their specific needs (accuracy vs. speed).

2. **Q: How does the system handle algorithm selection for different dataset sizes?**
   A: The system allows manual algorithm selection but provides guidance through:
   - Time complexity information
   - Performance comparisons
   - Real-time execution time display
   Users can make informed decisions based on their dataset size and requirements.

### Implementation Questions

1. **Q: How is the frontend-backend communication structured?**
   A: The system uses a RESTful API architecture:
   - Frontend: JavaScript with fetch API
   - Backend: Flask REST endpoints
   - JSON data format
   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

2. **Q: How does the map visualization handle real-time updates?**
   A: The map visualization uses Leaflet.js with:
   - Dynamic marker updates
   - Real-time route polyline drawing
   - Distance label updates
   - Priority-based marker coloring

### Design Questions

1. **Q: Why choose a web-based architecture instead of a desktop application?**
   A: Web-based architecture provides:
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Easy deployment and updates
   - No installation required
   - Accessible from any device with a browser

2. **Q: How was the priority system designed and why use 5 levels?**
   A: The 5-level priority system was chosen for:
   - Intuitive understanding (1-5 scale)
   - Sufficient granularity for most use cases
   - Balance between flexibility and complexity
   - Common in real-world priority systems

### Future Development Questions

1. **Q: How would you scale this system for enterprise use?**
   A: Enterprise scaling would require:
   - Database integration for persistence

   Future improvements could add:
   - Parallel processing
   - Data chunking
   - Progressive loading

2. **Q: What are the memory considerations for the Dynamic Programming solution?**
